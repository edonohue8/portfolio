# Responsive Portfolio

## Project Description

I was tasked with creating my first portfolio website utilizing Bootstrap's utilities.  This included enabling my webpages to be viewed on various devices or screen sizes.

### My Process/Steps

My first step was to create each webpage.  I copied and pasted the Bootstrap stylesheets into the 'head' of each page.  Afterwards, I copied and pasted the JavaScript from the Bootstrap site just above the closing 'body' tag.

Next, I chose a navbar from the Bootstrap site and made changes such as the position of the links displayed on the page.  I also edited each link appropriately to connect with the corresponding pages (i.e. Contact, Portfolio, About).  I then applied this to  each page.

In the 'index' or 'About Me' page, I used the Bootstrap grid system to display a profile photo of myself and a short narrative regarding my relevant experience as a web development programmer.

In the 'Contact' page, I used Bootstrap elements to create the contact form.

In the 'Portfolio' page, I used the Bootstrap grid system to display sample images where photos of my future projects will be.  For the images, I used https://unsplash.com.

After all the content was populated, I worked on the footer in the 'index' page.  I copied and pasted the Bootstrap stylesheet for the 'sticky-footer'.  I also added my own stylesheet, as well as applying extra style to my footer.  Afterwards, I applied the footer code to each webpage.

After my 'initial commit', I tested each link and used a HTML validation service to scan for errors in each of my webpages.  After making those changes, I made another commit towards github.

I also made another commit to clean up any non-semantic errors found in any of the webpages.
